# DAY 2 ASSIGNMENT
Question:

Create a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a point with (X,Y) co-ordinates. For example,
points = [(1,2),(5,8),(3,4)],
Write a for loop to iterate through this list. For each tuple, unpack the X and Y values into seperate variables. 
Use a conditional statement to check if the X co-ordinates is greater than the Y co-ordinate.
If X>Y, 
    print "The X co-ordinate is greater than the Y co-ordinate for point (X,Y)."
Otherwise,
    print "The Y co-ordinate is greater than or equal to the X co-ordinate for point (X,Y)."
